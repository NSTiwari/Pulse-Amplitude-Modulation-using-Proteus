# Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation-using-Proteus

This project aims to produce the simulation of Pulse Amplitutde Modulated waves using Proteus 7.8i.

Components used:
1) Resistors
2) Polarised Capacitors (variable capacitors)
3) Non-electrolytic Capacitors (non-variable capacitors)
4) 555 Timer/Oscillator
5) 4016 Bilateral Quad switch
6) Signal Generator
7) Oscilloscope
8) Battery

The original signal is a sinusoidal wave which gets sampled to produce a PAM sine wave.

Follow the steps in the videos uploaded to create the schematic circuit.
The output graph of the original (sinusoidal wave), sampling wave and the PAM wave is obtained.
